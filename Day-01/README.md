##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned the basic meaning of ethical hacking.  
Ethical hacking means testing systems and applications **with permission** to find security problems and fix them before attackers misuse them.

I understood that hacking is not always illegal.  
If hacking is done without permission, it is illegal.  
If hacking is done with permission to improve security, it is called ethical hacking.

I also learned about different types of hackers:
- **White Hat Hackers** work legally to secure systems.  
- **Black Hat Hackers** hack systems illegally for personal gain.  
- **Grey Hat Hackers** fall between legal and illegal actions.

Cybersecurity is important because websites and applications store personal data like usernames, passwords, and payment information.  
If security is weak, attackers can steal or damage this data.

##  Key Takeaways  
- Ethical hacking is legal only with permission  
- Not all hackers are criminals  
- Learning security basics is very important  
- Ethical hackers help protect users and systems
