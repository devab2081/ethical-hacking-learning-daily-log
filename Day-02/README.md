## 🧠 What I Learned Today  

Today I learned the basics of computer networking.  
Networking means connecting computers and devices so they can communicate with each other.

I learned that every device on a network has an **IP address**, which is used to identify it.  
Without an IP address, devices cannot communicate properly.

I also learned about **ports**.  
Ports are used to identify different services running on a system, such as web services or file services.

I understood that **protocols** are rules that control how data is sent and received.  
Two common protocols are TCP and UDP.

- **TCP** is reliable and ensures data reaches its destination correctly.  
- **UDP** is faster but does not guarantee delivery.

Networking is very important for ethical hacking because all attacks and data transfers happen through networks.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways  
- Networking is the foundation of ethical hacking  
- IP addresses help identify devices  
- Ports and protocols control communication  
- Understanding TCP and UDP is important for security
