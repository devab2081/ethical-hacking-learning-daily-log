# Web Basics – Simple Explanation (Day 05)

## How Do Websites Work?
A website works by sending requests from the browser to the server.
The server processes the request and sends a response back.

## What is HTTP?
HTTP is a protocol used for communication between a browser and a server.
It does not encrypt data.

## What is HTTPS?
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.
It encrypts data so that attackers cannot easily read it.

## Why HTTPS is Important
HTTPS protects user data such as passwords and personal information.
Most secure websites use HTTPS by default.

## Why This Matters for Security
Many web attacks happen because of weak or misconfigured web communication.
Understanding HTTP and HTTPS helps in identifying security issues.
