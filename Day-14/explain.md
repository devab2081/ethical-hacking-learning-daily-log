# Web Application Architecture – Simple Explanation (Day 14)

## What is Web Application Architecture?
Web application architecture is the structure of a web application.
It shows how the client, server, and database communicate with each other.

## Main Components
- Client: The user interface (browser or app)
- Server: Handles logic and processing
- Database: Stores application data

## How They Work Together
The client sends a request to the server.
The server processes the request and interacts with the database if needed.
The response is then sent back to the client.

## Why This Matters for Security
Understanding architecture helps identify where security controls should be placed.
It also helps in understanding how attackers may target applications.
