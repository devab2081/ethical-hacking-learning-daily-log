##  Date  
23-12-2025  

##  Topics Learned  
- What authentication means  
- Difference between authentication and authorization  
- What sessions are and why they are used  
- Common authentication-related security issues  

##  Tools / Platforms Used  
- Web security articles  
- OWASP documentation (concept level)  

##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about authentication and session management.  
Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, usually using a username and password.

I understood that authentication and authorization are different.  
Authentication checks the identity of a user, while authorization checks what the user is allowed to do after logging in.

I also learned about sessions.  
Sessions are used to keep users logged in after authentication, so they do not need to log in again for every request.

If sessions are not handled properly, attackers may take over user accounts.  
This makes authentication and session management very important for web security.

##  Key Takeaways  
- Authentication verifies user identity  
- Authorization controls user access  
- Sessions maintain user login state  
- Poor session handling can lead to account compromise
