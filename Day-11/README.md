##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about vulnerability assessment.  
Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying security weaknesses in a system or application.

I understood that a vulnerability is a weakness, while a threat is something that can exploit that weakness.  
Vulnerability assessment helps organizations understand what needs to be fixed before attackers can misuse it.

I also learned that vulnerability assessment focuses more on identifying problems rather than exploiting them.  
This makes it different from penetration testing.

##  Key Takeaways  
- Vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses  
- It helps prioritize security fixes  
- Not all vulnerabilities are equally dangerous  
- Regular assessment improves security
