### Personal Notes – Reconnaissance Basics

- Reconnaissance is the first step in ethical hacking.
- The main goal is to collect information before testing or attacking a system.
- Information gathered during recon helps understand how a system works.

### Passive Reconnaissance
- Does not involve direct interaction with the target.
- Uses publicly available information.
- Examples include search engines, public documents, and company websites.
- Less risky because the target usually does not notice it.

### Active Reconnaissance
- Involves interacting with the target system.
- Sends requests to gather information.
- More accurate but riskier than passive recon.
- Can sometimes alert the target system.

### Why Reconnaissance is Important
- More information reduces guesswork.
- Helps identify possible entry points.
- Saves time during later security testing.
- Helps defenders understand what information is exposed publicly.

### Things to Remember
- Always get permission before active reconnaissance.
- Ethical hackers use recon to improve security, not to exploit systems.
- Reconnaissance is useful for both attackers and defenders.
