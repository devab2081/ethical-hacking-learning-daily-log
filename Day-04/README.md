##  Date  
18-12-2025  

##  Topics Learned  
- What reconnaissance means  
- Difference between passive and active reconnaissance  
- Why information gathering is important  
- How attackers collect basic information  

##  Tools / Platforms Used  
- Google search  
- Public information sources  
- TryHackMe (theory sections)  

##  What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about reconnaissance, which is the first step in ethical hacking.  
Reconnaissance means collecting information about a target before any attack or testing.

I understood that there are two main types of reconnaissance.  
Passive reconnaissance is collecting information without directly interacting with the target system.  
Active reconnaissance involves interacting with the target to gather information.

I learned that attackers usually spend a lot of time on reconnaissance because better information makes attacks easier.  
Ethical hackers also use reconnaissance to understand systems and identify possible security risks.

##  Key Takeaways  
- Reconnaissance is the first phase of hacking  
- Information gathering is very important  
- Passive recon is safer and less detectable  
- Understanding recon helps in defense  

Today I revised passive and active reconnaissance concepts.
