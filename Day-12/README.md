## 🧠 What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about penetration testing.  
Penetration testing is the process of safely testing a system to see how vulnerabilities can actually be exploited.

I understood that penetration testing goes deeper than vulnerability assessment.  
While assessment finds weaknesses, penetration testing checks how serious those weaknesses are.

I also learned that penetration testing must always be done with permission.  
Ethical and legal approval is required before testing any system.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- It helps understand real-world impact  
- Permission is mandatory  
- Ethical testing improves system security
