## 🧠 What I Learned Today  

Today I learned about cookies, sessions, and tokens, which are used to manage user authentication and state in web applications.

I understood that cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user’s browser.  
They are often used to store session identifiers or preferences.

I learned that sessions are used on the server side to keep track of logged-in users.  
The browser sends a session ID with each request so the server knows who the user is.

I also learned about tokens.  
Tokens are used to represent user identity and are commonly used in modern web applications and APIs.

Understanding the differences between cookies, sessions, and tokens is important for identifying authentication and session-related security issues.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways  
- Cookies are stored in the browser  
- Sessions are managed on the server  
- Tokens represent user identity  
- Poor handling can lead to security risks
